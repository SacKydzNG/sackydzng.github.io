    <h5> I don't really know how to eat a carrot. <br>
      I've read books about carrots. <br>
      I've bought every single belonging of mine in carrot orange. <br>
      I can eat the green veggie part of a carrot. <br>
      Theoretically I should be able to eat a carrot using the tried-and-true method of "putting it in your mouth,
      taking
      a bite, chewing and then swallowing". <br>
      But I don't really know how to eat a carrot. <br>
      <br>
      I have read books on eating etiquette. <br>
      <br>
      No luck. <br>
      <br>
      I have read books SPECIFICALLY on carrot-eating etiquette. <br>
      <br>
      No dice. <br>
      <br>
      I can never eat a carrot. <br>
      I will never be able to eat a carrot. <br>
      Carrots are a delicacy completely out of my reach. <br>
      ... <br>
      ... <br>
      <br>
      I must make a choice: <br>
      <br>
      > Kill yourself. <br>
      <br>
      > Eat a carrot. <br>
      <br>
      > Be fine with the lack of carrots in your life. <br>
      <br>
      > Jerk off to carrot porn. <br>
